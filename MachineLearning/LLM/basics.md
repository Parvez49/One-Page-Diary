# LLM: 
 stands for Large Language Model, a type of AI deep neural networks trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language. Examples include GPT, BERT, and LLaMA.
 Large: large number of parameter.
 Language Model: 
 Language Model: NLP tasks -> question answering, translation, sentiment analysis.

 NLP for specific tasks but llm for wide range of nlp.

 GPT: Generative Pretrained Transformer: Generate new word.
 BERT: Biderectional Encoder Representation from Transformer. Predict hidden words in a given sentence.

 Zero Shot: Perform task without any prior example
 Few Shot: Understand and perform task with a few example or pieces of context.

### Making LLM:
 Pretraining: training on large dataset, diverse dataset.
 Fineturing: training on narrower dataset, specific dataset.

### Problem of LLM:
- Limited context window
- outdated knowledge base
- data privacy
- cost(machine resource)
- No connection with third party

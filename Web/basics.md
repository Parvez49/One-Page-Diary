## HTTPS / SSL Certificate Flow
- HTTPS = HTTP + TLS
- Browser requests URL: https://example.com
- TLS handshake starts (Transport Layer Security: is the security protocol that makes HTTPS secure)
  - Browser asks for secure connection to server
  - TLS = rules for creating an encrypted, authenticated connection between browser and server.
- Server sends SSL certificate From Nginx / Load Balancer / Gunicorn
- Browser verifies certificate: Trusted CA, Domain matches, Not expired / revoked, ❌ Fail → connection blocked
- Secure tunnel established: Encryption keys agreed
- HTTP request sent inside TLS: Encrypted data
- Server decrypts request: SSL terminator (Nginx / Gunicorn)
- Request forwarded to Django
  -  Plain HTTP
  -  Django → only processes HTTP logic, Django trusts server headers
